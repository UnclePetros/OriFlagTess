# OriFlagTess - An origami flagstone molecule design tool

OriFlagTess is an origami design software dedicated to calculate and construct single flagstone molecules.  

## Prerequisites

In order to run the software .NET Framework 4.72 is required.  
Latest version of Windows OS have it already available.  
If not, you can download it from here: [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)  

## Installation

Download this latest version (alpha version): [https://github.com/UnclePetros/OriFlagTess/releases/tag/v0.2-alpha](https://github.com/UnclePetros/OriFlagTess/releases/tag/v0.2-alpha)  
Unzip the package and launch _OriFlagTess.exe_ file executable. 

## Use

The software starts with a 4-pleat molecule construction.  
Use the molecule type combobox to choose a different molecule type.  
Use angles controls to change angles values of the molecule:  
- it is possible to set only the first n-1 angles of the n-pleat molecule; the last one is automatically calculated.  
Use sides controls to change sides dimensions of the molecule:  
- it is possible to set only the first n-2 side of the n-pleat molecule; the last 2 sides are automatically calculated.  

## For developers

If you want to make changes or modify the program, simply:

* Clone this repository
* Open OriFlagTess solution file with Microsoft VisualStudio 2019
